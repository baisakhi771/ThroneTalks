<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation

This repository can be cloned locally by running the following `git` command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DSProjects2024/thronetalk-game-of-thrones-summarizer.git
```
Please note that Git is required to run the above command. For instructions on downloading Git, please see [the GitHub guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

<a id="environment"></a>
### Environment
This application relies on several Python packages with specific version dependencies. Installing these packages may potentially lead to conflicts with existing packages within the workspace. To mitigate this issue, we suggest utilizing `conda` to establish an isolated Python environment containing all essential packages. You can access the list of required packages within the documentation. [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml) file.

To create the 'thronetalks' conda environment which contains all the required packages to run the app, run these commands:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate thronetalks
```
The second command activates the specific environemnt.


If you want to deactivate this environment in the future, then use the command:
```bash
conda deactivate
```

If you want to delete this environment, then use the following command:
```bash
conda remove --name thronetalks --all
```

<a id="data"></a>
### Data
The raw data for our project was obtained from two different sources:

1. Dialogues for each character - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gopinath15/gameofthrones
2. Scrapped metadata from IMBD - metadata for the episodes and the show.

Since all the metadata scraping is one-off and the show has finished airing, we are not expecting to run the scripts again. But we can use the file `scripts/data_cleaning.py` to generate the cleaned data again. (Note - scraper might fail because of IMDb's efforts to prevent web scraping, you might have to manually debug it and run it in batches of 10 episodes if so).

Run the following:
```bash
conda activate thronetalks
python ./scripts/data_cleaning.py
python ./scripts/get_metadata.py
conda deactivate
```
More details can be found [Readme](./scripts/README.md) and [data details](./examples/data.ipynb).

<a id="application"></a>
### Application
We generated our application through the open-source `streamlit` package. A local application can be generated with the code:
```bash
conda activate thronetalks
streamlit run thronetalk-game-of-thrones-summarizer/app.py
```
This will pop up a browser window with the functioning web-application.
More details can be found [here](./examples/README.md).

Note: While running this app locally inorder to generate summary, you will need to specify
```
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY = "YOUR KEY"
AZURE_ENDPOINT = "YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL ENDPOINT"
```
in a secrets.toml file within ```thronetalk-game-of-thrones-summarizer/.streamlit/secrets.toml```
