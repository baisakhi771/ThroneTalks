CHAT_COMPLETIONS_MOCK_RESPONSE = '''In the fantasy world of Westeros, the Seven Kingdoms are ruled
        by various noble families who are vying for the Iron Throne. The first episode of 
        Game of Thrones introduces us to this complex and politically charged landscape.\n\n
        The episode begins with the Stark family, who rule over the North, receiving a visit 
        from King Robert Baratheon. He asks Ned Stark, the head of the family, to become his 
        Hand of the King, a position that requires him to govern the kingdom in Robert's 
        absence. Despite his initial reluctance, Ned agrees to the offer out of duty.\n\n
        Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen is married off to Khal Drogo, 
        the leader of a nomadic horse-riding tribe called the Dothraki. Daenerys is initially 
        unhappy with her arranged marriage, but she slowly begins to embrace her new role and 
        culture.\n\nBack in Westeros, Ned's wife Catelyn receives a letter suggesting that 
        the Lannisters, another powerful family, may have been involved in the death of the 
        previous Hand of the King. Catelyn travels to King's Landing, the capital city, to 
        inform Ned and investigate further. She discovers that the Lannisters are indeed 
        plotting against the Starks.\n\nIn the capital, Ned's daughters Sansa and Arya 
        struggle to adapt to their new surroundings. Sansa is captivated by the charm 
        and wealth of the Lannisters, particularly Prince Joffrey, who she hopes to 
        marry one day. Arya, on the other hand, is more interested in sword-fighting 
        and defying traditional gender roles.\n\nAs tensions rise, Ned starts to uncover 
        more secrets and conspiracies. He learns that the previous Hand of the King was 
        murdered because he had discovered that all of King Robert's children were actually 
        fathered by the queen's brother, Jaime Lannister. This revelation puts Ned and his 
        family in grave danger.\n\nIn episode 2, Ned continues to investigate the death of 
        the previous Hand of the King. He discovers that the Lannisters were involved and 
        confronts the queen, Cersei, about her children's true parentage. However, Ned's 
        actions have dangerous consequences, as he becomes a target for the Lannisters.\n\n
        Meanwhile, Daenerys starts to embrace her role as Khal Drogo's wife and becomes 
        pregnant with his child. She also gains the loyalty of one of Drogo's bloodriders, 
        Jorah Mormont, who becomes her advisor.\n\nBack in the capital, Ned's illegitimate 
        son Jon Snow joins the Night's Watch, a group of men who guard the realm from 
        supernatural threats beyond the Wall. Jon faces challenges from his fellow 
        recruits but eventually gains their respect.\n\nAs the episode ends, 
        Catelyn captures Tyrion Lannister, whom she believes is responsible for her 
        son's attempted murder. This act further escalates tensions between the Starks 
        and the Lannisters, setting the stage for an intense power struggle in the Seven 
        Kingdoms.\n\nOverall, these two episodes set the stage for the complex web of 
        political intrigue, family rivalries, and supernatural elements that define the 
        world of Game of Thrones. The storylines are intricately woven, and the 
        characters face constant challenges and moral dilemmas as they navigate 
        this treacherous landscape.'''
