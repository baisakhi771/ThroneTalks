Winter Is Coming,"['In the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, a soldier of the ancient Night\'s Watch order survives an attack by supernatural creatures known as the White Walkers, thought until now to be mythical (and extinct for thousands of years). The order\'s platoon was patrolling the North side of the Wall, when the soldier stumbled across an entire village of wild-lings who had been torn from limb to limb and laid across in a Geo-metrical pattern on the ground. The soldier gets his colleagues to visit the spot, where they are brutally killed by the White Walkers and the entire village is now un-dead, with blue eyes.He attempts to abandon the order (by running off to the South of the wall) but is captured and sent to Castle Winterfell, which is ruled by Eddard ""Ned"" Stark (Sean Bean), Warden of the North, who decapitates the soldier for desertion. The soldier keeps talking about the white walkers till he is killed. Ned does not believe that the White Walkers are back, as they have been gone for thousands for years.\nEddard has 5 sons Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright), Rickon (Art Parkinson), Robb (Richard Madden), Brandon (10 yrs) and Jamie (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). Jon Snow (Kit Harington) is Ned\'s bodyguard and bastard son. The group finds 6 pups from a dead dire-wolf (a large wolf animal) (direwalls are never found South of the wall) and Ned orders the 6 pups to be adopted by his 5 sons and Jon. Jon gets the runt of the litter. Arya (Maisie Williams) & Sansa (Sophie Turner) are Ned\'s 2 daughters. Arya has a natural flair for weapons.In King\'s Landing, the capital of the seven Kingdoms, Jon Arryn, the King\'s Hand, dies under mysterious circumstances. King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) (ruler of the Iron Throne), Ned\'s longtime friend, travels to Winterfell to offer the position to him and propose marriage between his firstborn son Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Ned\'s older daughter Sansa (Sophie Turner). Ned\'s sister used to be married to Robert and is now dead. Robert used to love her very much. Ned\'s sister was killed by the Targaryen in the great war that established the 7 Kingdoms.\nSansa (who is still 13 yrs old) is smitten with Joffrey and wants to be married to him.\nBenjen is JOn Snow\'s uncle (Ned\'s brother), who comes to visit him at Winterfell.

Catelyn burns the letter and tells Ned about it, believing that the Lannisters are plotting against Robert. Ned knows he has to protect Robert and decides to take the post.Ned\'s 10-year-old son, Brandon, climbs a tower, where he witnesses Cersei having sex with her twin brother, Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), who then pushes him out the window from a presumably fatal height. Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) is Cersei\'s other brother and is known to be a lech and has the nickname ""imp"".Meanwhile across the narrow sea in Essos, the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen (Harry Lloyd) makes a deal with the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), who marries Viserys\' younger sister, Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), in exchange for providing Viserys an army (of 40,000 killers) to conquer Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne. Khla has never been defeated in combat. Daenerys doesn\'t like Khal, but is forced into marriage due to her brother\'s blind ambition. Viserys admits that he let all 40,000 of Khal men have sex with Daenerys, if that\'s what it took to reclaim his throne. As a wedding gift Daenerys is given the history of the seven kingdoms and 3 dragon eggs (the ages have turned them to stone), from a stranger Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. He had served the house of Targaryens for many yrs. Khal gifts her a white horse.']","At the castle Winterfell, Lord Ned Stark begins to believe that something is amiss.

The Rains of Castamere,"[""Robb discusses with Catelyn his plan to attack Casterly rock after joining with Walder Frey's armies. Catelyn agrees, but sees that the plan is risky because if Tywin attacks from King's Landing, Robb's forces will not have any place to retreat. They will be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.\nRobb arrives at the Twins and apologizes to Walder (for breaking his vow to marry one of his daughters or grand-daughters. Frey introduces all of them to Robb), who appears to accept. Robb promises to do everything so that the Freys and the Starks can once again be friends. Frey meets Talisa and calls her a pretty face and says he would have done the same at Robb's age without even a 2nd thought. Edmure marries Roslin (who is revealed to be a beauty) and they leave to consummate. Just after that, Walder's men murder Catelyn, Talisa and most of the Stark banner-men, while Roose Bolton, revealed as a Lannister loyalist, kills Robb.Sam, Gilly and her son arrive at the Wall and go to castle Nightfort, west of Castle Black. It was abandoned as it was too big and impossible to maintain. The castle Nightfort has a portal through the wall, just like Castle Black. This portal can be opened from the North side of the wall, if one can find it. Sam read about this in a book.Nearby, Jon refuses to kill a farmer (who is breeding horses for the Wall, as he feels the old man is no threat to the Wildlings). Tormund and Orell want to kill the farmer for his Gold and Steel. Tormuns wants to kill the farmer, so the Night's watch sends a patrol, whom they can ambush easily out in the open. Jon alerts the farmer by making noise with his sword.\nThe farmer had escaped the wild-lings on a horse, but they were in pursuit. he was cornered near where Bran & his party were resting. Hodor panics and starts making noises, which Orell hears. So, Bran gets into Hodor's head to calm him, while Jon is attacked. This is an ability not possessed by any Wildling. Orell wants Jon to kill the farmer, but he again refuses. Ygritte protects Jon.\nThen Bran gets into the dire-wolves around Jon and gets the dire-wolves to protect Jon, while Jon kills Orell and escapes, leaving Ygritte a furious behind with Tormund.Osha, Rickon and his dire-wolf depart for the Last Hearth (The Umbers are Stark banner-men and will protect Rickon), while Bran and his remaining company plan to go beyond the Wall. Osha is against going past the wall, but Bran and Jojen and Meera are determined. Osha tells them they can avoid climbing the wall by going through the Bay of Seals in a boat. The bay of seals is protected by a castle of the wall. But Bran says that of the 19 castles only 3 are manned. They sealed the gates with ice and stones before abandoning the castles, but Bran plans to open it up again.Daenerys sends Jorah, Naharis and Grey Worm to infiltrate Yunkai and open the city gate for her army. This plan was suggested by Naharis, as he knew the defenses of the city very well. But Jorah suspected that Naharis could be leading him and Grey worm into a trap, have them killed and then collect his fees from the Yunkai, which he cont have to split 3 ways now that his partners are also dead. Grey Worm trusts Naharis and that settles the matter for Daenerys.\nNaharis enters through the back gates, kills the guards, open the front gates and lets Daenerys's army inside. Yunkai soon falls to her forces as the slaves surrender and refuse to put up any fight.Arya also arrives at the Twins (under protection from Sandor.. Sandor and Arya have learned to tolerate each other. Arya promises to kill Sandor one day, by putting a sword through his eye) and witnesses a part of the massacre (She witnesses Robb's dire-wolf being killed in its cage), but Sandor knocks her unconscious and carries her to safety.""]","Robb, his wife Talisa and mother Catelyn arrive for the marriage of Edmure Tully to one of Walder Frey's daughters.

Walder ignores Catelyn's threat to slit his wife's throat, preferring his revenge on Robb over his own family. Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane arrives disguised as pork seller to deliver Arya during the slaughter, which even includes Robb's wolf, and manages to take her away before she can tempt fatally futile revenge. On their travel to the wall, Bran's party seeks shelter in an old tower, where he must force himself to use his warg powers to keep undetected.

The Laws of Gods and Men,"['In Essos, Davos asks the Iron Bank to back Stannis. The Iron Bank has loaned a tonne of gold to the Lannisters and Davos convinces the Bank that Stannis is their best chance to get that money back. The bank says that Stannis only has 4000 men and 32 ships, plus they have no provisions to even feed this army, let alone arm them for combat. Davos counters that Tywin (who is the real power in King\'s Landing) is 67 yrs old and when he dies, there is no reliable leader (not Tommen, not Cersei, not Jaime), and so Davos argues that Stannis is the natural choice. The bank decides to fund Stannis.\nWhile in Braavos, Davos also meet Salladhor Saan and re-assert his pirates to Stannis\' cause by paying him handsomely in gold coins.In Meereen, Daenerys adapts to her new role as queen, hearing her subjects many requests, including nobleman Hizdahr Zo Loraq (Joel Fry) (his father was a nobleman at Meereen and was crucified. His successfully argues with her (he says his father had argued against the crucifixion of children but was over-ruled on the council. Now he is still nailed to a post and being eaten by vultures, rotting in the sun) to get a decent burial for his father), and a peasant man whose goats were killed by Daenerys\' increasingly uncontrollable dragons (she pays the peasant 3 times over the value of his goats).In the Dreadfort, Yara leads a mission to rescue Theon. She is not willing to accept Ramsay\'s terms to abandon the Iron Islands and all the other lands they have won in the last months since war broke out. Yara scales the Dreadfort castle at night, with her platoon. Theon has been kept in the kennels with dogs. Yara reaches him slaying every soldier on their way. Theon, broken and panicked, refuses to go with her (he thinks its a trick and that its not Yara, but an impersonator sent by Ramsay), forcing Yara to leave him behind when Ramsay arrives with his men to thwart the rescue attempt. Ramsay rewards Theon\'s obedience and, in order to take Moat Cailin, tasks ""Reek"" to pretend to be ""Theon"".In King\'s Landing, Tywin puts a bounty (10 silver stags) on the Hound\'s head (as news reaches him that he killed 5 of Lannister soldiers at the tavern including Polliver) and instructs Varys to continue spying on Daenerys (3 dragons, staying in Meereen as Queen, army of unsullied and second sons and 2 knights advising her (Jorah and Barristan)). Oberyn is on the small council and correctly deducts that Varys is from Esso (the eastern land where Daenerys picked up the Unsullied army). Oberyn guesses that Varys is gay, but Varys corrects him that he is asexual. He doesn\'t like boys or girls.

Sansa\'s necklace was what carried the poison inside the wedding ceremony and found its way into Joffrey\'s drink. The poison that killed Joffrey was one of the ones stolen from Pycelle), Cersei (Tyrion threatened to harm Joffrey on numerous occasions), and Varys, who give compelling though tangential testimony. Tyrion is not allowed to cross-question any witness.Jamie pleads for Tyrion\'s life in private with Tywin. Jaime says that as a Kingsguard he cannot have any children, and so if Tywin kills Tyrion, the Lannister line comes to an end. Tywin agrees to spare Tyrion if Jamie agrees to return to Casterly Rock and marry a woman.

The Watchers on the Wall,"[""The Night's Watch prepares for the Wildling invasion. Jon admits to Sam that he slept with Ygritte while he spent his time with the wild-lings. Sam says that he and Gilly never had sex, as she has just had a baby and that she never offered. Sam argues that their vows talk about talking no wives and not fathering children, but don't prohibit sex specifically.\nThe Wildlings are spying on the Night's watch by Warging into an owl. Styr challenges Ygritte that she still loves Jon Snow, but she announces to the entire pack that she will be the one who kills Jon Snow during the attackThe Night's watch have 105 men at Castle Black, against a 100,000 strong army of the wild-lings. Gilly and Little Sam arrive at Castle Black (she passes the Wildling camp on her way to castle black), where Sam hides them as women are not allowed inside Castle Black. Sam takes Gilly and little Sam to a chamber deep inside the Castle and locks the door from outside.\nMaester Aemon reveals to Sam that he was Aemon Targaryen in his past life (he was the designated future king), before he came to the wall. He used to love a girl once.

The Night's watch load barrels of oil on the catapults on the wall.\nJust before the attack Alliser agrees with Jon that they should have sealed the tunnel while they had the chance.The Wildlings attack from both sides of the wall. Tormund's army gets through from the south and engages the Night's Watch. Ygritte kills many archers guarding the gate with her own accurately aimed arrows. The guards of the Night's watch are poorly trained and are unable to take advantage of their advantageous & fortified positions.\nBeyond the wall, the wild-ling army hangs back just beyond the range of the archers on the wall. A small platoon led by a giant on a mammoth approaches the wall and is impervious to the arrows shot from the top. Many of the wild-lings reach the wall and start climbing it. JOn knows they wont summit before dawn the next day.Alliser Thorne goes down the wall to fight in the southern part, leaving Janos Slynt in charge. However, Slynt is incompetent and is tricked into going down the main level by Jon (who tells him that they got word that Brother Thorne needs him at the ground level), effectively leaving Jon in charge.\nAt the Southern end, Tormund and Styr break through the gates and are confronted by Thorne and his men in battle. Slynt finds the battle at the ground level too gruesome and finds the same room to hide, by chance, where Sam had hidden Gilly. Tormund defeats Thorne in battle, but he manages to escape.Sam decides to get to the top of the wall, to get Jon as there is no leader on the ground level (with Slynt hiding and Thorne injured). Jon comes back down with Sam to take control of the situation inside Castle Black. Jon asks Sam to release his dire-wolf Ghost.\nAfter watching Jon kill Styr, Ygritte prepares to kill him but hesitates and is fatally shot by Olly (who is just a little kid who operates the lifts on the wall.).One giant break through the tunnel leading into Castle Black but is killed by Grenn and five others (who hold the inner gate on Jon's orders), at the cost of their own lives.\nWith the help of Jon's dire-wolf, Ghost, the Night's Watch secure the ground level of Castle Black, leading to Tormund's arrest.The wall climbers are obliterated by a massive scythe. The Wildlings retreat though Jon predicts their return the very next night (as they were just testing defenses and Mancer has many more mammoths and giants to throw at the Wall).

When the battle begins, they are beset on both sides of the wall. From the north, Mance Raydor's army attacks sending men climbing up the wall and others to attempt entry through the tunnel.

His bloodline stretched back to before the First Men. Mance tells Jon that he has sent 400 wild-lings to climb the wall on an unmanned stretch, 5 miles away from their current position. He is not going to back off since he is afraid for the wild-lings because winter is coming and if the wild-lings are not South of the wall by then, they all die. Mancer wants a safe passage across the tunnel in the wall in exchange for peace.\nMance is interrupted when Stannis and his huge army overrun the Wildling camp, taking Mance as prisoner.

He says that Jojen knew that he would die once Bran reached his destination, but he went anyway.\nThe old man tells Brandon that he wont walk again, but he will fly.In the Vale, Brienne and Podrick encounter Arya and the Hound, whom Brienne engages and critically wounds. Brienne had discovered the true identity of Arya Stark and wants to take her home, but Sandor convinces Arya that Brienne is paid by the Lannisters and hunting Sandor for the bounty on his head (since she carries the sword given to her by Jamie). Arya hides while the fighting is underway and eventually Brienne leaves with Podrick.\nThe Hound begs Arya to kill him, but she takes his money and leaves him for dead.

Cersei then tells Jaime that she has told Tywin the truth and also adds that she does not consider Tyrion as family, as he was the reason behind their mother's death.\nJaime releases Tyrion (with Varys waiting in the bay to sail him away to the free cities). Instead of leaving right away, Tyrion double backs to the castle and finds Shae in Tywin's bed and fatally strangles her, then confronts and kills Tywin in the privy (Tyrion tells Tywin that he really loved Shae).

Haughty king Stannis wants the Wildlings to join his army to take the North from Roose Bolton and thus revenge Robb, but will only 'pardon' them if their king Mance kneels for him, which he refuses despite confident Jon Snow's plea and knowing the alternative is the stake, where Jon's arrow cuts his agony short.

Prince and master of coin Mace Tyrell feels honored to be dispatched to renegotiate the crown's debt with the iron bank, but the other small council members realize she's culling them systematically. Tyrion is abducted by Jorah Mormont and amused to learn he's to be offered to Daenerys, his destination, as a make up present by the banished knight. Inspired by Cersei, the High Sparrow converts his purist sect into a militia reviving the zealot terror of the Faith Militant, which spares no 'sinners' instant 'justice' without recourse. Olyvar can just escape from the brothel, but even lover prince Loras is imprisoned, and despite queen Maergery's best effort boy king Tommen only gets a sanctimonious commiseration from Cersei and lacks the guts to order the golden guard to make way for him to the 'praying' high sparrow.

Kill the Boy,"[""Brienne and Podrick arrive at an inn near Winterfell and smuggle a message to Sansa (The Boltons have moved from Moat Cailin and set up camp in Winterfell and carried out the necessary repairs to the Castle), offering her help if it is needed. The message is to light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower, if she is ever in distress. The broken tower is where Bran was pushed off by Jaime.\nWhen Sansa discovers Theon is at Winterfell (he is still kept with the dogs in the kennels), Ramsay forces him to apologize to her for betraying the Starks (and killing Bran and Rickon). Myranda is super pissed that Ramsay has totally ditched her for Sansa. Ramsay had promised her that he would marry her. Ramsay intends to keep Myranda on as his mistress, even after he is married to Sansa.\nmeanwhile Roose's new wife Walda (Elizabeth Webster) is now preggers and Ramsay is nervous that if its a boy, Roose might change his mind and remove his claim from the throne. Roose re-iterates that he could have had Ramsay thrown into the river when he was first brought to him by his peasant mother, whom Roose had raped. But he saw that Ramsay was is son, as he is even now. Sansa is secretly happy looking at Ramsay's discomfort.\nRoose tells Ramsay that eventually Stannis will march towards Winterfell with his army from Castle Black.At the Wall, Tormund accepts an alliance with the Night's Watch that allows Wildlings to settle south of the Wall (They would have to fight with the Night's watch when the time comes). Tormund accepts as he knows that the Walkers are coming and they will hit the wild-lings first. Jon and Tormund (Kristofer Hivju) travel to Hardhome to meet with the Wildlings. Hardhome is near the ocean and Jon asks Stannis to lend him his fleet to transport the wild-lings to sought of the wall. Hardhome is one week away by horse-ride.\nThis decision is not taken very well by the Night's watch at all. They feel Jon has betrayed them by making peace with Wildlings. Especially hurt is Jon's young squire Olly (Brenock O'Connor), whose whole family was butchered by the wild-lings. Yet, Jon's logic is that wild-lings are better safe than part of army of the dead.Word reaches Castle Black (Sam and Aemon) on how Daenerys fights for the freedom of the slaves and would not rest till it is secured. They both admire her and the work she is doing.\nStannis's army leaves for Winterfell, taking Selyse and Shireen with them. before leaving, Sam tells Stannis that he killed white walker with Dragon glass. He tells Stannis that when the army of the dead arrives, the realm of men will need to know how to fight it. Stannis encourages Sam to keep reading to find an answer.\nSir Davos (Liam Cunningham) advises Stannis to wait for Jon to return with the wild-lings, so they have a bigger army. But Stannis overrules him. Winter is approaching and they have to start before they get snowed in at Castle Black. He decides to take Shireen and Selyse along with him to Winterfell. Stannis knows that they wouldn't be safe at Castle Black without Jon.In Meereen, as Grey Worm recuperates, he and Misandei develop a romantic relationship. Daenerys feeds a Meereenese nobleman to her dragons, Viserion and Rhaegal, and imprisons the others (incuding Hizdahr Zo Loraq). She suspects their hand in the riots taking place inside the city. Daenerys is torn between increasing strictness in the city versus providing freedom to the former slaves. Meesandei counsels her to find a path that no-one else could see (like she always does).\nShe later agrees to reopen the fighting pits and weds Loraq to facilitate peace.At sea, Tyrion and Jorah sail through Valyria (the ancient abandoned city of the Valyrians), seeing Drogon flying overhead. They are attacked by stone men (the disease is contagious and spreads with touch) and escape, but Mormont is infected with grey-scale but he hides it from Tyrion (Same decease that Shireen had as a kid, before she was cured).

The Dragon and the Wolf,"[""The Unsullied & Dothraki army reaches the King's Landing. The armies are formidable. Bronn and Jaime know that they are facing certain defeat. Theon, Tyrion, Sandor, Jon, Davos, Brienne and many others have traveled there. Daenerys flies in with her dragon. A million people stay in King's Landing. Cersei orders Gregor to kill Daenerys, Tyrion and Jon in that order, in case anything goes wrong during the discussions.Euron taunts Theon that he has Yara and will kill her if Theon doesn't surrender. Sandor confronts Gregor and promises to kill him before the war is over. Daenerys wants a truce till the army of the dead is dealt with. Cersei still believes that the army of the dead is a rumor.\nAt King's Landing, the wight is presented to the Lannisters and their supporters (Jon demonstrates that the wights can be killed by fire or by dragon-glass. Their army is at least 100,000 strong). Euron is so terrified that he decides to take his fleet back to the Iron Islands (the army of the dead cant swim)Cersei demands Jon's neutrality in the Great War, but he upholds his oath to Daenerys, provoking Cersei to end discussions. Tyrion meets privately with Cersei (who still blames Tyrion for killing Tywin, Myrcella, Tommen.. Tyrion says he loved the children whether Cersei cares of it or not), apparently gaining her alliance as she commits her armies to help fight the army of the dead, alongside Jon and Daenerys. Cersei later reveals to Jaime that she really intends to use the Golden Company of Braavos (a band of 20,000 mercenaries that she has hired with help of a loan from the Iron Bank. Euron had not left for the Iron Islands, he had gone to Essos to bring the Golden Company to the King's Landing) to secure her hold on Westeros. Disgusted, Jaime deserts her and rides north despite Cersei ordering him not to.Aboard a ship bound for White Harbor (the plan is that the Dothraki will ride to Winterfell and Jon & Daenerys (who are sailing together on a ship) will pick the Unsullied from White Harbor and join the Dothraki at a mid-point to ride into Winterfell together), Jon and Daenerys make love.\nAt Dragonstone, Theon earns his men's respect (by beating up a commander who insults Yara, the same men who rescued Theon from the sea) and leads them to rescue Yara from Euron.At Winterfell, Littlefinger sows dissent by exploiting Arya's threatening demeanor toward Sansa (Sansa confides in Petyr that Arya could want her dead as she wronged her family. She found the letter as proof of Sansa's betrayal. After Sansa is dead, Arya would become the Lady of Winterfell), leading to a trial. Sansa has also got word that Jon has bent the knee to Daenerys.\nTo his surprise, a united Sansa, Arya, and Bran accuse Littlefinger of murder, conspiracy, and treason, which Bran confirms with his visions. Sansa says that the whole issue between Starks and Lannisters started when Petyr got Lysa to poison Jon Arynn and got her to write a letter to Catelyn that it was the Lannisters who poisoned him. She then also says that He wanted a strife between Sansa and Arya, so he could profit from it. The Knife used to attack Bran belonged to Petyr and not anybody else.\nDeserted by the Lords of the Vale, Littlefinger is sentenced to death by Sansa and executed by Arya.Samwell arrives at Winterfell and meets with Bran. They discuss Jon's parentage and through Sam's earlier research and Bran's visions, they extrapolate that Jon is a true-born Targaryen named Aegon, the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne. His parents - Rhaegar Targaryen (Wilf Scolding) and Lyanna Stark (Aisling Franciosi) - married in secret.\nIt also means that King Robert's rebellion was built on a lie.

At Eastwatch, the Night King riding his dragon and the White Walker army attack the Wall.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The Lannister court formally receives John and Daenerys's delegation at the ancient arena where the old dragons withered. Thyrion's plea is coldly received by Cersei, until the Hound lets the undead out of the box and Jon demonstrates it can only by killed by fire or dragon-glass. An armistice to fight fight the greater common enemy is acceptable, but off the table when Jon refuses to revoke his oath to the dragon queen. Jaime gets Thyrion an audience to push their sister Cersei, daring to let the Mountain kill him, which seems to talk her over after spotting her pregnancy. Jon and Daenerys celebrate the outcome making love, but Cersei confides into Jaime she intends to reconquer the North after the rivals exhausted themselves.. Bran reveals to Sam that Jon was given in Ned's care as secret legitimate heir to the Iron throne, being born Aeon Targaryen. Theon dares his uncle Euron Greyjoy, who was boarding to flee back to the Islands, to duel and kills him, yet calls for loyalty to his missing sister.
